# DataScienceCapstoneProject
Completed project/exercise as a part of the Python Masterclass in Data Science and Machine Learning course on Udemy.

## Findings
The goal of the project was to see if Fandango, a website that displays reviews as well as sells movie tickets, displays higher ratings for movies to boost their ticket sales.

I used NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the data from Fandango and from other websites whose sole purpose is to display movie ratings. These include Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and IMDB. The analysis showed that Fandango did in fact show higher ratings for movies that received significantly lower ratings on other websites, going as far as showing a rating of 4.1 for "Taken 3", the mean rating of which is around 1.86 across other platforms!!! This is a clear indication that Fandango is indeed biased towards showing higher ratings for movies to boost ticket sales.

## Conclusion and future direction

The findings from this project can be used along with data for ticket sales to see if there is a correlation between ticket sales and the ratings displayed on Fandango, further solidifying the bias. Users should research and be aware of the artificially boosted ratings on Fandango when deciding on a movie to watch.
